  <strong>You may also want to look <a href="https://www.viola-priesemann.de/">at the old website</a> for more information.</strong><br> Our reseach focuses on the theory of complex systems, from information processing in neural networks to disease spread in population networks. We combine the study of learning and self-organization principles in these two types of networks with approaches from statistical physics and information theory. We thereby aim to improve the working of biologically-inspired artificial neural networks on the one hand, and to face future pandemics and similar health crises on the other hand.
