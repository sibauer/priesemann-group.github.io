                        Remember looking at the infection statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic and the way the
                        numbers looked so random, even unpredictable? And although unpredictability is quite big of a
                        word, we can agree that in contrast to Influenza (of which we expect one peak every year around
                        late winter), COVID-19 showed no comparable stability or structure – so why is that?
                        <div class="content col col-xl-5 col-md-12 align-self-center">
                            <img src="img/chaos-blog_1-data.svg" />
                        </div>

                        Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation took a deeper look
                        at what drives such infection dynamics, including how societal reactions can influence the
                        spread of the infection itself. More specifically, they showed with the help of a model that
                        <em>society’s behaviour can actually induce complex dynamics</em>. Not only that: Such
                        complexity can
                        even be <em>optimal</em> when considering expected costs.

                        <br><br>
                        So let's dive into what they found and come back to the real-life data later - then with new
                        knowledge at hand.
                        <br><br>
                        <h5>So let's say there's a virus - but what drives infection waves?</h5>
                        As we know from Influenza, <span class="seasonality">seasonality</span> is one aspect that
                        creates oscillation. We observe infection numbers decreasing in the summer and rising in the
                        winter, as people stay indoors more and it's easier to get infected etc. The green graph
                        visualizes this yearly peak. (The x-axis counts in years; the y-axis represents infections in
                        percent.)
                        <div id="plot1"></div>

                        <br>
                        Yet the factor that gained importance during COVID-19 is society's preventative disease
                        <span class="mitigation">mitigation</span>, meaning different measures to fight infections, such
                        as the introduction of masks or the reduction of social interactions. The intensity of these
                        mitigation measures depends on the severity of the disease spread, i.e., how many people are
                        infected – so as infection numbers rise, society's mitigation does too, until that eventually
                        leads to the wave getting broken and infections going down again.
                        <dl>
                            <dt>
                                <div id="plot2"></div>
                            </dt>
                            <dd><br><br><br><br><br>
                                <top>When infection numbers are low, mitigation is accordingly lowered – which then
                                    leads to recurring infection waves. Generally speaking, as we adapt to the infection
                                    numbers, we correspondingly proceed to change them – resulting in yet another
                                    adaptation and change. As a sole factor, this "feedback loop" would result in
                                    dynamics such as shown by the blue graph.</top><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                        </dl>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Two driving forces interacting can create complexity</h5>
                        However, if seasonality and mitigation have comparable influences and affect each other
                        similarly, a combination of both factors can result in complex infection dynamics. These give
                        rise to completely different graphs, as shown by this example.
